Tetris
======

Tetris clone in C++ built in VS express 2013 with SDL 2
This is a personal exercise in using SDL 2.0 and C++ with which I am inexperienced.

To compile this project, you will need SDL 2.0 + SDL_ttf 2.0 and VS Express 2013.
While I have not tested it myself, there should be no reason for this project to not compile
with G++ in Linux.
